Objective: We have the chosen dataset from Household Power Consumption which available from 2006 to 2010. Our ultimate goal is to predict the Household Power Consumption Prediction on upcoming week based on the parameter is given in the Dataset by trains them using data from the last 7 days.  

Outcome: We were able to build the models to predict the Household Power Consumption on upcoming week by using influential factors for the decision so that we can produce efficient and precise Household Power Consumption.
